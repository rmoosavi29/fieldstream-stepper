This is a pilot project to implement Stepper.
Change [the file](src/steps/index.ts) to change the number and tag of the stepper.
The stepper has been implemented so that you can go to the previous and next steps using the buttons on the bottom of the page, but you can only go to the previous steps with the elements on top.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
